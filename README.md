# Browser History Manager

This repository contains a simple Java implementation of a browser history manager using a doubly linked list. The `BrowserHistory` class allows navigation to new URLs, as well as moving backward and forward through the history.

## Class Overview

### Node

The `Node` class represents a single page in the browser history. It contains the following fields:
- `String url`: The URL of the webpage.
- `Node prev`: A reference to the previous page in the history.
- `Node next`: A reference to the next page in the history.

#### Constructor
```java
public Node(String url)
```
Creates a new `Node` with the specified URL.

### BrowserHistory

The `BrowserHistory` class manages the browsing history using instances of the `Node` class.

#### Constructor
```java
public BrowserHistory(String homepage)
```
Initializes the browser history with the specified homepage URL.

#### Methods
- `public void goTo(String url)`: Adds a new page to the history and moves to it.
- `public boolean goBack()`: Moves back to the previous page in the history if possible.
- `public boolean goForward()`: Moves forward to the next page in the history if possible.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `BrowserHistory` class:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    BrowserHistory history = new BrowserHistory("https://www.example.com");

    history.goTo("https://www.google.com");
    history.goTo("https://www.openai.com");

    System.out.println("Current URL: " + history.current.url);

    history.goBack();
    System.out.println("After going back, Current URL: " + history.current.url);

    history.goForward();
    System.out.println("After going forward, Current URL: " + history.current.url);
}
```

## Explanation

A doubly linked list is used for this implementation because it allows efficient traversal in both directions (backward and forward) with minimal time complexity. Each node in the list represents a webpage, and the list keeps track of the current page, previous pages, and next pages.
